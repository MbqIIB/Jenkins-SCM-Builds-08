        <propertiesContent>#RTC command exit code and its relevant message
0=The command completed successfully.
1=There was a syntax error on the command line.
2=The client could not connect to the named repository URI with the credentials supplied by the user.
3=A failure occurred for an unknown reason
4=An internal error indicating that a subcommand could not be loaded.
5=The sandbox is misconfigured (its root could not be found, or is not shared).
6=A resource name collision was detected in the sandbox. An unshared resource in the sandbox has the same name as a shared resource in the repository workspace. This prevented the shared resource from being loaded.
7=A failure occurred due to an unknown internal error
8=The requested operation could not be completed because the sandbox is out of sync with the repository workspace. The user should reload or re-share the sandbox.
9=The requested operation could not be completed because a selector (name, alias, or UUID) supplied by the user either does not match enough items, or matches too many.
10=not used
11=There is a resource conflict in one or more repository workspaces accessed by the subcommand. The user must resolve those conflicts before continuing.
12=An unknown subcommand name was used.
13=reserved (OSGi exception)
14=A request to move a resource failed because the target exists and is unshared, or the target path is invalid.
15=Remote data changed during command execution. Re-run the command.
16=The requested operation could not be completed because it would introduce a gap into the change set history.
17=The requested operation was blocked by Team Process.
18=The requested operation failed because the user lacked one or more repository permissions. The message returned provides more information about the failure.
19=The requested operation could not complete because preconditions were not met.
20=The requested operation attempted to transfer a file that has improper line terminators or encoding.
21=The requested operation could not complete because it would create an n-way conflict in the change set history.
22=The requested operation could not complete because it would create one or more items that have no parent.
23=reserved (OSGi exception)
24=reserved (OSGi exception)
25=One or more specified repository items were not found.
26=Server error.
27=The sandbox is in use by another RCP process (an eclipse GUI or another Rational Team Concert source control command line client).
28=The requested operation could not complete because the repository workspace is misconfigured: the client could not find an item in the repository workspace. The user should verify that any repository workspace paths are correct.
29=The requested operation could not complete because of a license limitation.
30=The requested operation could not complete because but the item&apos;s state is inappropriate.
31=The file system daemon didn&apos;t receive an initial connection within the alloted amount of time.
32=The communication with the repository timed out.
33=Some of the properties could not be fetched for the specified files.
34=The requested operation cannot continue because there are files that are not checked in.
35=The property could not be set for the specified file.
36=The repository information was incorrectly specified with respect to an item.
37=The change set could not be completed.
38=The suspend operation cannot be performed on the suspended change set.
39=Encountered an IOException.
40=The requested operation could not be completed because the change set is not in history.
41=Service failure encountered when communicating with the repository.
42=Indicates that the mime type could not be set for the specified file.
43=Indicates that the daemon closed the stderror before printing the connection coordinates.
44=Indicates that the specified load rules cannot be processed because it has inaccessible items or has invalid load rules.
45=Indicates that delivering changes would create conflicts in the stream.
46=Indicates that the requested state of the versionable is deleted.
47=Indicates that we could not determine the repository URI for the given repository id.
48=Indicates that a server state mismatch has been detected. This can happen when we try to connect to the server from a daemon which has been active through the server rename process.
49=Indicating the user to rerun the command.
50=Indicates that one or more items are locked in the stream.
51=Indicates that a failure occurred due to an unexpected condition.
52=Indicates that an accept succeeded, but there were no incoming changes, so the workspace remains unchanged.
53=Indicates that a deliver succeeded, but there were no changes to deliver to the repository.
54=Indicates that one or more of the workspaces that are loaded in the sandbox are unreachable; therefore, the output from the status command does not include the status of all the workspaces in the sandbox.
101=Indicates that the zimport subcommand cannot find a component to own the project that is being created, with the mapping file as specified. Check the mapping file for errors.
102=Indicates that the zimport subcommand cannot find a project for the member to import with the mapping file as specified. Check the mapping file for errors.
103=Indicates that a data set could not be browsed for a member to import with the zimport subcommand.</propertiesContent>
